            <h3>Tabular</h3>
            <p>The appearance of a paper tablet.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Tenacity</h3>
            <p>The strength of a mineral; its resistance to breaking, crushing, bending, or tearing. Terms commonly used
                to describe the tenacity of a mineral are brittle, sectile, malleable, flexible, elastic, ductile, and
                tough.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Tetragonal</h3>
            <p>Tetragonal crystals have three axes at right angles of which only two lateral axes are equal.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Tetrahexahedron</h3>
            <p>A crystal form of the isometric system, bounded by twenty-four equal triangular faces, four to each face
                of the cube.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Tough</h3>
            <p>Strong and firm in texture but flexible and not brittle; capable of resisting great strain without coming
                apart.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Triclinic</h3>
            <p>Triclinic crystals share three axes, all having different lengths and perpendicular to the others.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Tufted</h3>
            <p>Refers to a crystal aggregate in the form of fibrous crystal clumps.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Twin Crystal</h3>
            <p>Two portions of a crystal having a definite crystallographic relationship.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Twinning</h3>
            <p>An intergrowth of two or more single crystals of the same substance.</p>

            <br>

            <h1>V</h1>

            <h3>Variety</h3>
            <p>A mineral showing differences in color, other physical properties, or minor variations in composition
                from the typical species material.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Vein</h3>
            <p>zone or belt of mineralized rock lying within boundaries clearly separating it from neighboring rock. It
                includes all deposits of mineral matter found through a mineralized zone or belt coming from the same
                source.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Veinlet</h3>
            <p>A small vein</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Vesicle</h3>
            <p>A small cavity in a glassy, igneous rock formed by the expansion of a gas bubble or steam during the
                solidification of the rock.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Vitreous</h3>
            <p>Luster similar to freshly broken glass; brightly reflective.</p>

            <br>

            <h1>W</h1>

            <h3>Waxy</h3>
            <p>Mineral luster that is only slightly reflective; typical of minutely granular surfaces.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>Wiry</h3>
            <p>A mineral occurring as thin wires, often twisted like the strands of a rope.</p>
